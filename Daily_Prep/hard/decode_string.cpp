/* You are given a string s consisting of lowercase alphabet characters, digits, and brackets"(" and ")". s encodes a longer string and is represented as concatenation of n(t), where n is the number of times t is repeated, and t is either a regular string or it's another encoded string recursively.

Return the expanded version of s. Note that t can be the empty string.

Example 1
Input
s = "2(ye)0(z)2(2(po)w)"
